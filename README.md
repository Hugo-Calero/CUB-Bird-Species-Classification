# CUB-Bird-Species-Classification

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning classifier to predict bird species. This is a multiclass classification problem, since the training data used comes
from the CUB data set containing 200 bird species. After the experimentation the best model achieved an accuracy of 88.5% in the test set, using the InceptionV3 model. 
The model weights for the feature extarction layers were obtained from a pretrained model on the iNaturalist dataset.
